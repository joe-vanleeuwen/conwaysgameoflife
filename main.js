// Each celll is in one of two possible states, alive or dead.

// The following transitions occur:

// 1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by under-population.
// 2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
// 3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overcrowding.
// 4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

// A tick is the transition from one generation to the next.
